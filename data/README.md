# Data folder

All files in this folder will be ignored except for the README files.

* Raw data (e.g. as downloaded from 3rd parties) should be placed in the `raw` folder.
* The output of data pipeline scripts should go in the `processed` folder.
* The final combined data file (for analyses/dashboards) should go in the `final` folder.
